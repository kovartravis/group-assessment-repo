FastTrack'D - Third Assessment
===============================

## Overview

For this assessment, you are tasked with implementing an AngularJS web app front end for the [Second Assessment API](https://github.com/wmarttala/second-assessment-skeleton) using the Angular Material component library and Webpack build tool.

## Grading

Aside from the code itself, the core component of this assessment that will be graded is a presentation. You will be expected to present your groups work in an individual presentation and code review. You will be graded on your ability to present the project & the clarity of your understanding of all parts of the project, not just the portions that you are directly responsible for designing and creating. AngularJS, HTML, and CSS skills are required to complete this assessment, but it is teamwork and presentation skills that are paramount.
